This project a contains a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. 
In addition to this, we reorder this data set from large to small. 
All statistics are rounded down to the nearest integer. 
After analysis and sorting is done, we print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
